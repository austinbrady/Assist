## User Experience

### Example Conversations

**New Brand**:
```
User: "Design a logo for my coffee shop called 'Bean Dreams'"
Assistant: "I love that name! Let me create some concepts. 
            You prefer modern, minimalist designs, right? 
            Should I incorporate coffee bean elements?"
User: "Yes, and make it work in black and white too"
Assistant: "Perfect. Here are 5 concepts. Which direction feels right?"
User: "I like concept 3, but can you make the bean more abstract?"
Assistant: "Absolutely! Here's the refined version with a more 
            abstract coffee bean. I've also created variations 
            for different use cases - horizontal, vertical, and 
            icon-only versions."
```

**Iterative Refinement**:
```
User: "The colors feel off"
Assistant: "Let me adjust. I remember you prefer warm, earthy 
            tones. Should I try a coffee brown with a cream 
            accent, or would you prefer something more vibrant?"
User: "Coffee brown and cream sounds perfect"
Assistant: "Done! I've updated the logo with a rich coffee 
            brown (#3E2723) and cream (#FFF8E1). I've also 
            created a color palette guide for your brand."
```

**Brand Consistency**:
```
User: "Now I need a logo for my new bakery, 'Sweet Dreams'"
Assistant: "I see the connection to 'Bean Dreams'! Should this 
            be a sister brand with a similar style, or something 
            completely different?"
User: "Similar style, but more playful"
Assistant: "Perfect! I'll create a logo that matches your 
            minimalist aesthetic but with playful typography and 
            a sweet treat element. It'll work alongside your 
            coffee shop branding."
