Unzip PackagedFiles. It will be a .txt file with some assets you need to change, starting with your Google API Key.
Don't get stressed out though, this is about as easy as it gets. Simply, go to https://aistudio.google.com/, login with your google account.
Once you're logged in, click Create API Key, type in Assist, then copy your API key into PackagedFiles.txt.
Once you've added your Google API Key, save the document.
Close out of your application. Quit it all the way, dont just close the window.
Rename the file .env, press "use .env" and your API Key will be saved to the project.

This will allow you to leverage both Ollama and Gemini for your API for maximizing its capabilities. 
If you do not add your own API Key to Assist, it will still work, just not as well.
